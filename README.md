# DLIMP

Dataloading is my passion.

## Installation
Requires Python >= 3.8.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kvablack/dlimp
cd dlimp
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
Better external documentation is TODO, but the source code is fairly well-documented. The main entrypoint for dataloading is `dlimp.dataloader.make_dataset`. Scripts for converting data into the "dlimp format" go in `scripts/`.
